    {
      "role": "Student",
      "content": "A left shift indicates haemoglobin has higher affinity for oxygen, so unloading is impaired. This can occur with alkalosis, hypothermia, low CO₂, or fetal haemoglobin. Clinically, it means tissues may receive less oxygen despite normal saturations."

    {
      "role": "Student",
      "content": "Anaemia reduces oxygen content because there is less haemoglobin, even if saturation and PaO₂ are normal. Oxygen delivery may still be maintained by increasing cardiac output, but reserve is reduced and patients desaturate more quickly."
